### Finding Issues to Work On

1. **Check the [Issues](https://github.com/langtalks/swe-agent-langgraph/issues)** tab for open tasks
2. **Look for labels**:
   - `good first issue` - Great for newcomers
   - `help wanted` - Community contributions needed
   - `enhancement` - New feature development
   - `bug` - Bug fixes needed
3. **Join [Discussions](https://github.com/langtalks/swe-agent-langgraph/discussions)** to propose new ideas

## 📝 Development Workflow

### 1. **Create a Feature Branch**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# OR
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 2. **Development Guidelines**

#### Code Style
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use Black for formatting
- **Type Hints**: Required for all new code
- **Docstrings**: Use Google style for functions and classes
- **Variable Names**: Descriptive and meaningful

#### Architecture Patterns
- **State Management**: Use Pydantic models for all state
- **Agent Design**: Follow the existing architect → developer pattern
- **Tool Integration**: Implement tools following LangGraph patterns
- **Message Handling**: Use proper LangChain message types

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Required for all new functionality
- **Integration Tests**: For agent workflows
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >80% coverage
- **Fixtures**: Use pytest fixtures for common test data

### 3. **Code Quality Checks**
```bash
# Format code
uv run black .
uv run isort .

# Type checking
uv run mypy agent/

# Linting
uv run flake8 agent/

# Run tests
uv run pytest --cov=agent
```

### 4. **Commit Guidelines**

Use conventional commits:
```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat: add multi-step research loop to architect agent"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix: resolve state persistence issue in developer agent"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation for new tools"

# Tests
git commit -m "test: add integration tests for GitHub MCP"
```

### 5. **Submit Pull Request**

1. **Push your branch**
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

2. **Create Pull Request** with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Reference to related issues
   - Screenshots/demos if applicable
   - Test results and coverage

3. **PR Checklist**:
   - [ ] Tests pass
   - [ ] Code formatted with Black
   - [ ] Type hints added
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] Changelog entry added (if applicable)

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
uv run pytest

# Specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_architect.py

# With coverage
uv run pytest --cov=agent --cov-report=html

# Integration tests only
uv run pytest tests/integration/
```

### Writing Tests

#### Unit Tests
```python
import pytest
from agent.architect.state import SoftwareArchitectState

def test_architect_state_initialization():
    state = SoftwareArchitectState()
    assert state.research_next_step is None
    assert state.implementation_plan is None
```

#### Integration Tests
```python
async def test_architect_to_developer_workflow():
    # Test complete workflow from architect to developer
    initial_state = {"implementation_research_scratchpad": [HumanMessage("Add feature")]}
    result = await swe_agent.ainvoke(initial_state)
    assert result["implementation_plan"] is not None
```
