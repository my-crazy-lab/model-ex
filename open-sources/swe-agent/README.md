## 🚀 Features

- **Intelligent Code Planning**: AI architect analyzes requirements and creates detailed implementation plans
- **Automated Code Generation**: Developer agent executes plans with precise file modifications
- **Multi-Agent Workflow**: Separate planning and implementation phases for better reliability
- **Codebase Understanding**: Advanced code analysis using tree-sitter and semantic search
- **Incremental Development**: Atomic task breakdown for safer, more manageable changes

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system uses a two-stage LangGraph workflow:

### 1. Architect Agent - Research & Planning
![Architect Agent](./static/architect.png)

The architect agent:
- Researches the codebase structure and patterns
- Analyzes requirements and creates hypotheses
- Generates detailed implementation plans with atomic tasks
- Uses tools for code search and semantic understanding

### 2. Developer Agent - Implementation
![Developer Agent](./static/developer.png)

The developer agent:
- Executes implementation plans step by step
- Performs atomic code modifications with precision
- Creates new files and modifies existing ones
- Validates changes against the original requirements

### Workflow Overview
```
User Request → Architect (Research & Plan) → Developer (Implement) → Results
```

**Key Components:**
- **State Management**: Structured data flow between agents using Pydantic models
- **Tool Integration**: File system operations, code search, and structure analysis
- **Research Pipeline**: Hypothesis-driven exploration of codebases
- **Atomic Execution**: Granular tasks for reliable implementation

## 🔄 Agent State Management

The system uses a hierarchical state management approach with Pydantic models for type safety and validation. Each agent maintains its own state while sharing common entities for seamless data flow.

### Main Agent State (`AgentState`)

The top-level orchestrator state that manages the overall workflow:

```python
class AgentState(BaseModel):
    implementation_research_scratchpad: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]
    implementation_plan: Optional[ImplementationPlan] = None
```

**Fields:**
- `implementation_research_scratchpad`: Message history from research and planning phase
- `implementation_plan`: Structured plan created by architect agent for developer execution

### Architect Agent State (`SoftwareArchitectState`)

Manages the research and planning phase with hypothesis-driven exploration:

```python
class SoftwareArchitectState(BaseModel):
    research_next_step: Optional[str] = None
    implementation_plan: Optional[ImplementationPlan] = None  
    implementation_research_scratchpad: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages] = []
    is_valid_research_step: Optional[bool] = None
```

**Fields:**
- `research_next_step`: Current hypothesis or research direction being explored
- `implementation_plan`: Generated structured plan with atomic tasks
- `implementation_research_scratchpad`: Research conversation history and tool outputs
- `is_valid_research_step`: Validation flag for research hypothesis quality

**Workflow:**
1. Generate research hypothesis → Validate hypothesis → Conduct research → Extract implementation plan

### Developer Agent State (`SoftwareDeveloperState`)

Handles the step-by-step implementation of the architect's plan:

```python
class SoftwareDeveloperState(BaseModel):
    implementation_plan: Optional[ImplementationPlan] = None
    current_task_idx: Optional[int] = 0
    current_atomic_task_idx: Optional[int] = 0
    diffs: Optional[Diffs] = None
    atomic_implementation_research: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages_with_clear]
    codebase_structure: Optional[str] = None
    current_file_content: Optional[str] = None
```

**Fields:**
- `implementation_plan`: Plan received from architect agent
- `current_task_idx`: Index of current file-level task being implemented
- `current_atomic_task_idx`: Index of current atomic change within the task
- `diffs`: Generated code differences for precise file modifications
- `atomic_implementation_research`: Research specific to current implementation step
- `codebase_structure`: Current snapshot of target codebase structure
- `current_file_content`: Contents of file being modified

**Workflow:**
1. Iterate through tasks → Research specific implementation → Generate diffs → Apply changes

### Shared Entities

These Pydantic models provide the data contracts between agents:

#### `ImplementationPlan`
```python
class ImplementationPlan(BaseModel):
    tasks: List[ImplementationTask]
```
The top-level plan containing all file-level implementation tasks.

#### `ImplementationTask`  
```python
class ImplementationTask(BaseModel):
    file_path: str                    # Target file for modifications
    logical_task: str                 # High-level description of changes
    atomic_tasks: List[AtomicTask]    # Granular modification steps
```
Represents changes needed for a specific file.

#### `AtomicTask`
```python
class AtomicTask(BaseModel):
    atomic_task: str            # Specific code modification instruction
    additional_context: str     # Research context for this change
```
The smallest unit of implementation - a single code change.

#### `DiffTask` (Developer-specific)
```python
class DiffTask(BaseModel):
    original_code_snippet: str    # Exact code being replaced
    task_description: str         # Detailed change instructions
```
Precise diff instructions for code modifications.

### State Flow Example

```
User Request
    ↓
AgentState {research_scratchpad: [HumanMessage("Add auth")]}
    ↓
SoftwareArchitectState {
    research_next_step: "Find existing auth patterns",
    implementation_research_scratchpad: [research_messages...]
}
    ↓ (after research)
SoftwareArchitectState {
    implementation_plan: ImplementationPlan([
        ImplementationTask(
            file_path: "auth.py",
            atomic_tasks: [AtomicTask("Add User model")]
        )
    ])
}
    ↓
SoftwareDeveloperState {
    implementation_plan: <received_plan>,
    current_task_idx: 0,
    current_atomic_task_idx: 0,
    current_file_content: "# auth.py content"
}
    ↓ (after implementation)
Final Result: Modified codebase
```

### State Management Benefits

- **Type Safety**: Pydantic validation prevents state corruption
- **Traceability**: Complete message history for debugging
- **Resumability**: State can be persisted and resumed
- **Modularity**: Each agent manages its own concerns
- **Atomicity**: Granular task breakdown enables precise control
