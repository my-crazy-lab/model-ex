# Text Classification - Sentiment Analysis & Spam Detection

## Overview
Build intelligent text classification systems for analyzing product review sentiments and detecting spam emails, helping businesses understand customer feedback and improve email security.

## Mini Feature Ideas
- **Product Review Sentiment Analysis**: Classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral
- **Email Spam Detection**: Identify and filter spam emails automatically
- **Customer Feedback Categorization**: Sort feedback into categories (complaint, praise, suggestion)
- **Content Moderation**: Detect inappropriate or harmful content
- **Intent Classification**: Understand user intent in customer service interactions

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Data Preparation
- [ ] Collect labeled datasets for sentiment analysis (Amazon reviews, IMDB, etc.)
- [ ] Gather spam/ham email datasets (Enron, SpamAssassin)
- [ ] Implement data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Handle class imbalance using sampling techniques
- [ ] Split data into train/validation/test sets (70/15/15)
- [ ] Create data loaders and batch processing

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering
- [ ] Implement text preprocessing (tokenization, lowercasing, punctuation removal)
- [ ] Create TF-IDF vectorization pipeline
- [ ] Implement word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText)
- [ ] Add n-gram features (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams)
- [ ] Extract linguistic features (POS tags, named entities)
- [ ] Implement feature selection techniques

### Phase 3: Model Development
- [ ] Implement baseline models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
- [ ] Build neural network classifiers (LSTM, GRU, CNN)
- [ ] Implement transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa)
- [ ] Create ensemble methods combining multiple models

- [ ] Calculate performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- [ ] Create confusion matrices and classification reports
- [ ] Implement ROC curves and AUC analysis
- [ ] Add model interpretability tools (LIME, SHAP)

### Phase 5: Model Optimization
- [ ] Perform hyperparameter tuning (grid search, random search)
- [ ] Implement regularization techniques (dropout, L1/L2)
- [ ] Add early stopping and learning rate scheduling
- [ ] Optimize model architecture and layer sizes
- [ ] Implement model compression and quantization
- [ ] Create model versioning and experiment tracking

### Phase 6: API & Integration
- [ ] Build REST API for classification endpoints
- [ ] Implement batch processing capabilities
- [ ] Add real-time classification streaming
- [ ] Create confidence score thresholding
- [ ] Implement result caching and optimization
- [ ] Add API rate limiting and authentication

### Phase 7: Deployment & Monitoring
- [ ] Containerize application with Docker
- [ ] Set up cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- [ ] Implement model serving with TensorFlow Serving or TorchServe
- [ ] Add monitoring for model drift and performance degradation
- [ ] Create alerting system for classification anomalies
- [ ] Implement A/B testing for model updates

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: scikit-learn, PyTorch/TensorFlow, Transformers
- **Libraries**: NLTK, spaCy, pandas, numpy
- **Hardware**: CPU sufficient for traditional ML, GPU for deep learning
- **Storage**: 10-50GB depending on dataset size and model complexity
- **API**: FastAPI or Flask for serving predictions

## Success Metrics
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Accuracy > 85%, F1-score > 0.83
- **Spam Detection**: Precision > 95%, Recall > 90%, False positive rate < 1%
- **Response Time**: < 100ms for single prediction, < 5s for batch of 1000
- **Model Stability**: Performance degradation < 5% over 6 months

## Potential Challenges
- Handling sarcasm and context-dependent sentiment
- Dealing with evolving spam techniques
- Managing false positives in spam detection
- Handling multilingual text and domain adaptation
- Ensuring model fairness and avoiding bias
