# Text Summarization - Article & Document Summary

## Overview
Develop an intelligent summarization system that can automatically generate concise summaries of long articles, research papers, and documents while preserving key information and main ideas.

## Mini Feature Ideas
- **News Article Summarizer**: Generate brief summaries of news articles
- **Research Paper Abstract Generator**: Create abstracts for academic papers
- **Meeting Notes Summarizer**: Condense long meeting transcripts
- **Legal Document Summary**: Summarize contracts and legal documents
- **Book Chapter Summaries**: Create chapter-by-chapter book summaries

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Data Collection & Preparation
- [ ] Gather summarization datasets (CNN/DailyMail, XSum, Reddit TIFU)
- [ ] Collect domain-specific documents (news, academic, legal)
- [ ] Implement text preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Handle different document formats (PDF, HTML, plain text)
- [ ] Create train/validation/test splits
- [ ] Implement data quality checks and filtering

### Phase 2: Extractive Summarization
- [ ] Implement sentence scoring algorithms (TF-IDF, TextRank)
- [ ] Build sentence ranking and selection system
- [ ] Add position-based and length-based features
- [ ] Implement clustering-based sentence selection
- [ ] Create keyword and phrase extraction
- [ ] Add redundancy removal mechanisms

### Phase 3: Abstractive Summarization
- [ ] Implement sequence-to-sequence models (LSTM, GRU)
- [ ] Build transformer-based models (T5, BART, Pegasus)
- [ ] Add attention mechanisms for focus on important parts
- [ ] Implement copy mechanisms for handling rare words
- [ ] Create pointer-generator networks
- [ ] Add coverage mechanisms to avoid repetition

### Phase 4: Model Training & Fine-tuning
- [ ] Set up training pipeline with appropriate loss functions
- [ ] Implement teacher forcing and scheduled sampling
- [ ] Add beam search and nucleus sampling for generation
- [ ] Fine-tune pre-trained models on domain-specific data
- [ ] Implement gradient clipping and regularization
- [ ] Create checkpointing and model saving

### Phase 5: Evaluation & Metrics
- [ ] Implement ROUGE metrics (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L)
- [ ] Add BLEU score evaluation
- [ ] Create human evaluation framework
- [ ] Implement factual consistency checking
- [ ] Add readability and coherence metrics
- [ ] Create comparative evaluation against baselines

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement multi-document summarization
- [ ] Add query-focused summarization
- [ ] Create hierarchical summarization for long documents
- [ ] Implement controllable summarization (length, style)
- [ ] Add multilingual summarization support
- [ ] Create domain adaptation mechanisms

### Phase 7: API & User Interface
- [ ] Build REST API for summarization endpoints
- [ ] Implement batch processing for multiple documents
- [ ] Create web interface for document upload and summarization
- [ ] Add summary length control and customization
- [ ] Implement real-time summarization for streaming text
- [ ] Create export functionality (PDF, Word, plain text)

### Phase 8: Deployment & Optimization
- [ ] Optimize model inference speed and memory usage
- [ ] Implement model quantization and compression
- [ ] Set up cloud deployment with auto-scaling
- [ ] Add caching for frequently summarized content
- [ ] Implement load balancing and failover
- [ ] Create monitoring and logging systems

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: PyTorch/TensorFlow, Transformers library
- **Libraries**: NLTK, spaCy, rouge-score, datasets
- **Hardware**: GPU with 16GB+ VRAM for training large models
- **Storage**: 100-500GB for datasets and model weights
- **API**: FastAPI with async support for handling large documents

## Success Metrics
- **ROUGE-1 F1**: > 0.40 for news articles
- **ROUGE-2 F1**: > 0.18 for news articles
- **ROUGE-L F1**: > 0.36 for news articles
- **Human Evaluation**: Informativeness > 4.0/5.0, Readability > 4.0/5.0
- **Processing Time**: < 5 seconds for 1000-word document
- **Factual Accuracy**: > 90% fact preservation rate

## Potential Challenges
- Maintaining factual accuracy in generated summaries
- Handling very long documents that exceed model context limits
- Preserving important details while achieving desired compression ratio
- Dealing with domain-specific terminology and concepts
- Ensuring coherence and readability in generated summaries
- Avoiding extractive bias in abstractive models
