# Text Embedding - Semantic Search System

## Overview
Develop a sophisticated semantic search system that understands the meaning behind queries and documents, enabling intelligent document retrieval based on conceptual similarity rather than just keyword matching.

## Mini Feature Ideas
- **Document Search Engine**: Find relevant documents based on semantic meaning
- **FAQ Matching System**: Match user questions to relevant FAQ entries
- **Research Paper Discovery**: Find related academic papers and citations
- **Product Recommendation**: Recommend products based on description similarity
- **Knowledge Base Search**: Intelligent search through company documentation
