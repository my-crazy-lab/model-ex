# Image Captioning - Automatic Image Description

## Overview
Build an intelligent image captioning system that automatically generates descriptive text for uploaded images, useful for accessibility, content management, social media automation, and e-commerce product descriptions.

## Mini Feature Ideas
- **Website Accessibility**: Generate alt-text for images automatically
- **Social Media Automation**: Create captions for social media posts
- **E-commerce Product Descriptions**: Generate product descriptions from images
- **Content Management**: Auto-tag and describe uploaded media
- **Visual Storytelling**: Create narrative descriptions for photo albums
