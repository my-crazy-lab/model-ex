# Voice Conversion - Celebrity Voice Synthesis

## Overview
Develop an advanced voice conversion system that can transform one person's voice to sound like another person (such as a celebrity), while preserving the original speech content and naturalness.

## Mini Feature Ideas
- **Celebrity Voice Cloning**: Convert speech to sound like famous personalities
- **Voice Anonymization**: Protect speaker identity while preserving content
- **Character Voice Acting**: Create different character voices for audiobooks
